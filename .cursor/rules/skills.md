## Available Skills

You have access to the following skills. When a user's task matches a skill, use the `read_skill` MCP tool to load full instructions.

<available_skills>

<skill>
<name>test-driven-development</name>
<description></description>
</skill>

</available_skills>

## Usage

Invoke `read_skill(name: "skill-name")` via the MCP tool when needed.

The tool returns the skill content as markdown. Any `@filename` references in the content are automatically resolved to absolute paths.
